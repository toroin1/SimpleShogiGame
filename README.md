# SimpleShogiGame
A simple game of shogi using java swing
So this is my first big project using java 
Some illegal moves are still in the game.
Also there might be memory leak in GameBoard or PlayerHand due to circular dependency
or just badly implemented code.
I will be really glad if someone can point out the bad design decision.
Thanks for taking the time.
